### About my file

This program prints out various information and data on space missions. By implementing the use of for loops and
if statements, we are able to extract particular data that we want from the lists, such as the number of missions
conducted, the amount of successful missions, and more. 

Functions were used to make the code in main more readable, as well as to make it easier to edit later.
